# Runbook: Twilio Incident Response (NOT APPLICABLE)

**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE

## Reason

Twilio is **not integrated** into this system:
- No Twilio credentials are provisioned.
- No Twilio client libraries are installed or used.
- No data flows to Twilio.

Because Twilio is not a vendor in use, there is **no operational incident response** required at this time.

## Trigger condition

If Twilio is ever enabled (credentials added, SDK integrated, or data flows established), this runbook **must be expanded before go-live** with:
- Twilio contacts and escalation paths.
- Incident detection signals and alerting.
- Credential rotation and containment steps.
- Customer communication requirements.
