# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-02-01

## 1. Scope and roles

This policy describes how CleanWithSnapshot processes personal data for the core application and related services. We act as a **data controller** for account, billing, and operational data that we collect directly from customers or end users. We do **not** act as a processor for SMS or voice communications because no SMS/voice services are used. **This system does not use SMS/voice providers.**

## 2. Data we collect

We collect the minimum data needed to provide the service, including:

- **Account and access data:** user name, email address, organization identifiers, authentication metadata.
- **Billing and transaction data:** subscription tier, invoice references, payment status, and Stripe customer identifiers (no raw card data is processed by us).
- **Operational data:** service usage events, audit logs, and configuration changes.
- **Support communications:** messages you send to support (email content and attachments).

## 3. Data we do **not** collect

- **SMS, voice, or call data:** We do not collect or process call recordings, call metadata, SMS content, or telephone interaction logs.
- **Phone/SMS provider data:** We do not use any SMS or voice providers and therefore do not send or receive SMS/voice data through third parties.

## 4. Vendors and subprocessors

We use the following vendors to deliver the service:

- **Stripe** — Payment processing (data processor for billing data).
- **SendGrid or SMTP provider** — Email delivery (data processor for outbound email content).

**Twilio is not used and is not a data processor for this system.**

## 5. Legal bases (GDPR)

Where GDPR applies, we process personal data based on:

- **Contract performance:** to provide the service, manage subscriptions, and process payments.
- **Legitimate interests:** to maintain service security, prevent fraud, and improve reliability.
- **Compliance with legal obligations:** to meet accounting, tax, and regulatory requirements.

## 6. CCPA/CPRA notice at collection

For California residents, we collect the categories of personal information listed above for **business purposes** such as providing the service, processing payments, preventing fraud, and maintaining security. We do **not** sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 7. Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to meet operational and legal obligations. Retention rules and schedules are documented in [Data Retention](./DATA_RETENTION.md).

## 8. International transfers

Where vendors process data outside your jurisdiction, we rely on appropriate transfer mechanisms (for example, Standard Contractual Clauses). See the vendor documentation in `docs/vendor/` for details.

## 9. Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. Contact support to exercise these rights.
