# Security Model

## Authentication mechanisms
- **Admin/Dispatcher/Finance/Viewer Basic Auth**: enforced by `AdminAccessMiddleware` with per-role permissions and auditing (`app/api/admin_auth.py`). Credentials come from env vars (owner/admin/dispatcher/accountant/viewer pairs).
- **Admin safety gates**: `/v1/admin/*` and `/v1/iam/*` run through `AdminSafetyMiddleware` for two controls: (1) `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST_CIDRS` enforces CIDR allowlisting using trusted proxy resolution, returning 403 Problem+JSON on mismatch; (2) `ADMIN_READ_ONLY=true` blocks POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE with a 409 Problem+JSON, keeping read-only GETs available during incidents. During incidents, owners/admins can mint short-lived, org-scoped break-glass tokens via `/v1/admin/break-glass/start` (reason and TTL required). Tokens are hashed at rest, sent once in `X-Break-Glass-Token`, expire automatically, and every start + write using break-glass is logged to `admin_audit_logs` with the provided reason.
- **SaaS JWT (org-scoped)**: access tokens validated by `TenantSessionMiddleware`; sessions stored in DB and refreshed via `/v1/auth/refresh` (`app/api/saas_auth.py`, `app/api/routes_auth.py`). `require_org_context` enforces org presence when SaaS tokens are expected.
- **SaaS admin MFA**: when `ADMIN_MFA_REQUIRED=true`, OWNER/ADMIN memberships must present a valid RFC6238 TOTP during login/refresh to receive an `mfa_verified` claim on the session JWT. `/v1/auth/2fa/enroll` returns an `otpauth://` URI and base32 secret once; `/v1/auth/2fa/verify` enables TOTP and rotates sessions; `/v1/auth/2fa/disable` (OWNER-only) tears down secrets and revokes sessions. `/v1/admin/*` and `/v1/iam/*` reject SaaS tokens missing `mfa_verified` with a 401 Problem+JSON `type` of `mfa_required`. Legacy Basic Auth accounts are not MFA-capable—prefer disabling `LEGACY_BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED` in production and migrate operators to SaaS identities.
- **Worker portal tokens**: signed tokens using `WORKER_PORTAL_SECRET`, validated by `WorkerAccessMiddleware` and endpoints in `app/api/worker_auth.py`/`routes_worker.py`.
- **Client portal tokens**: HMAC tokens for invoice/portal links using `CLIENT_PORTAL_SECRET` with TTL (`app/api/routes_payments.py`, `app/settings.py`).
- **Client portal isolation**: client magic links set an org context and are required for every portal call; booking/invoice/photos are resolved only when the authenticated client owns the record and the invoice/order lives under the caller's org. Signed photo downloads stay behind authenticated `/client/orders/{id}/photos/{photo_id}/signed_url` hops and reuse org-aware storage signing.
- **Public endpoints**: `/healthz`, estimator, chat, leads, slots/bookings (with optional captcha), and Stripe webhook; all others require auth.
- **IAM onboarding (temp passwords)**: admins issue org-scoped temp passwords via `/v1/iam/users` or reset endpoints; hashes are stored immediately and never logged. Temp-password users are marked `must_change_password` and are blocked by `PasswordChangeGateMiddleware` from all routes except login/refresh/me/logout/change-password until they set a new password.
- **Unauthorized vs forbidden**: 401 is reserved for missing/invalid credentials or expired sessions; authenticated-but-disallowed calls (role, org, CSRF, consent) return 403.

## Authorization & RBAC
- **Admin roles**: OWNER/ADMIN/DISPATCHER/FINANCE/VIEWER map to permissions in `admin_auth.py` and SaaS membership roles in `saas_auth.py`.
- **Operator productivity queue RBAC** (release-grade hardening applied):
  - **Photos queue** (`/v1/admin/queue/photos`): requires DISPATCH permission (dispatcher/admin/owner roles).
  - **Invoices queue** (`/v1/admin/queue/invoices`): requires FINANCE permission (accountant/finance/admin/owner roles).
  - **Assignments queue** (`/v1/admin/queue/assignments`): requires DISPATCH permission (dispatcher/admin/owner roles).
  - **Dead letter queue** (`/v1/admin/queue/dlq`): requires ADMIN permission (admin/owner roles only).
  - **Timeline endpoints** (`/v1/admin/timeline/*`): requires VIEW permission (all roles), but PII is masked for viewer role.
- **PII masking policy**: Viewer role sees masked PII (emails masked as `u***@domain.com`, phone numbers as `780-***-1234`, sensitive text truncated). All other admin roles see unmasked data. Timeline endpoints apply masking to email addresses and sensitive metadata fields (subjects, comments, bodies), and action strings avoid embedding raw recipients.
- **SaaS entitlements**: per-plan limits for workers/bookings/storage enforced via dependencies in `app/api/entitlements.py` backed by `app/domain/saas/billing_service.py`.
- **Org scoping**: `request.state.current_org_id` populated by SaaS tokens or `default_org_id`; DB queries filter by `org_id` on every joined table. Admin finance/report/export/reconciliation endpoints (`/v1/admin/reports/*`, `/v1/admin/exports/*`, `/v1/admin/export-dead-letter`, `/v1/admin/finance/reconcile/*`) and payments are constrained to the caller's org via `_org_scope_filters` and `resolve_org_id`. **Operator productivity queues** enforce org scoping on all joins: photo queue joins Booking and Worker with explicit org_id constraints; invoice queue joins Lead with org_id constraint; assignment queue joins Lead and Team with org_id constraints; DLQ and timeline queries filter by org_id at the top level and verify booking ownership before querying NPS/support tickets.

- **Postgres row-level security**: As a safety net, RLS is enabled for org-owned tables (leads, bookings, invoices, invoice_payments, workers, teams, order_photos, export_events, email_events). Each request sets a context var-backed `app.current_org_id` and `SET LOCAL app.current_org_id = '<uuid>'` runs at transaction start for Postgres connections. Queries must continue to include explicit `org_id` filters; RLS blocks cross-org access if a filter is missed. SQLite runs without RLS for local testing.

## Session and token handling
- **Access/refresh**: access JWTs carry `org_id`, `role`, `sid`; refresh tokens rotate sessions and revoke prior ones (`saas_auth.py`, `app/infra/auth.py`).
- **Password hashing**: Argon2id default with bcrypt fallback; legacy SHA-256 hashes auto-upgrade (`app/infra/auth.py`).
- **Revocation**: logout/password change revokes session records; `PasswordChangeGateMiddleware` blocks requests until password updated. Admin-driven temp-password resets/deactivations call per-org session revocation so stale access/refresh tokens cannot be replayed.
- **CSRF**: token helpers in `app/infra/csrf.py` for stateful flows.

## Token TTLs and limits
- **Access token TTL**: `AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES` (default 15 minutes) controls JWT validity returned from `/v1/auth/login`/`refresh`.
- **Session TTL**: `AUTH_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES` caps session `expires_at`; refresh tokens rotate sessions before expiry.
- **Refresh token TTL**: `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES` (default 14 days) caps refresh token use; rotation sets `revoked_reason` on prior session.
- **Temp passwords**: one-time secrets returned only in admin IAM responses; optional emailing is controlled by `EMAIL_TEMP_PASSWORDS`. They remain valid only until the user sets a new password, after which all sessions are rotated.

## Transport and rate limits
- **Rate limiting**: middleware using Redis or in-memory limiter with proxy-aware client key resolution (`app/main.py`, `app/infra/security.py`).
- **Admin idempotency**: dangerous admin actions (payments, resends/replays, bulk updates, IAM resets) require an `Idempotency-Key` header. Requests are hashed on method/path/normalized JSON body and persisted per-org in `admin_idempotency`; repeated hashes replay the stored response while mismatched payloads return a 409 Problem+JSON. Per-org action rate limits share the same limiter infrastructure and are applied before execution.
- **CORS**: origins enforced via settings; `STRICT_CORS` recommended for prod (`app/main.py`, `app/settings.py`).
- **Metrics/headers**: security headers middleware sets X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy (`app/main.py`). Admin Basic Auth middleware only applies to `/v1/admin/*`; `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` are allowlisted from admin credentials.

## Data access and privacy
- **Photos/files**: access via signed URLs or tokenized download endpoints; TTL and MIME/size limits enforced (`app/api/photo_tokens.py`, `app/infra/storage/backends.py`).
- **Invoices and payments**: invoice tokens HMAC-signed and scoped to invoice ID/org (`app/api/routes_payments.py`).
- **Invoice repair**: finance-only reconcile action (`POST /v1/admin/finance/invoices/{id}/reconcile`) is org-scoped, recomputes succeeded payments and outstanding balance without minting new Stripe payments, and downgrades paid invoices with no funds back to SENT/OVERDUE instead of fabricating rows. Every reconcile call is audited with before/after snapshots for status, paid/outstanding cents, and succeeded payment counts.
- **Stripe events view**: `/v1/admin/finance/reconcile/stripe-events` exposes only metadata (event id/type, org, invoice/booking references, status, error text) and omits raw webhook payloads to avoid leaking cardholder details or PII embedded in Stripe objects.
- **Exports**: outbound webhooks restricted by allowlist and optional HTTPS enforcement (`app/infra/export.py`).
- **PII**: avoid logging PII; request logging uses request_id/paths without body dumps by default. Structured logs automatically redact emails, phone numbers, street addresses, Authorization headers, bearer tokens, and signed URL/query tokens.

## Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Per-client limits default to `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`; captcha available for `/v1/leads` when `captcha_mode=turnstile` to deter spam (`app/infra/captcha.py`, `app/api/routes_leads.py`).

## Photo access policy
- Uploads are MIME/size validated and stored under org/order prefixes; minting download links always requires authenticated callers (worker/admin/client) hitting `/photos/{id}/signed_url`. Tokens encode org/order/photo (and optional UA hash or one-time Redis guard), expire after `photo_url_ttl_seconds` (60s default), and are validated by `/signed-download` before redirecting. Responses set `no-store`/`no-cache` headers and never return bare cloud object URLs. Local/S3/R2 use presigned GETs with TTL; Cloudflare Images redirects include signed exp/sig and optional variants (original/thumbnail) to block hotlinking.
